What protocol (or protocols) constitutes the "thin waist" of the Internet protocol stack? Check all that apply.

- [ ] HTTP

- [ ] WiFi
- [ ] Ethernet

## The end-to-end principle.
Which of the statements below are true statements regarding  the "end-to-end principle"? Check all that apply.

- [ ] The end-to-end argument advocates placing functionality at the network edge to optimize performance, such as end-end delay.
- [x] The end-to-end argument allows that some redundant functionality might be placed both in-network and at the network edge in order to enhance performance.
- [X] The end-to-end argument advocates placing functionality at the network edge because some functionality cannot be completely and correctly implemented in the network, and so needs to be placed at the edge in any case, making in-network implementation redundant.

## The Internet hourglass.
What is meant when it is said that the Internet has an “hourglass” architecture? See the picture below if you are unfamiliar with an "hourglass".

- [ ] ... after matching on the source and destination IP address in the datagram header, the action taken is to forward the datagram to the output port associated with that source and destination IP address pair.
- [ ] Packets flow from top to bottom down the stack, like sand in an hour glass.  Then, on the receiver side, if the hourglass is reversed,  packets flow up the stack, like sand flowing in the opposite direction.
- [x] The Internet protocol stack has a “thin waist” in the middle, like an hourglass.  The Internet Protocol (IP) is the only network-layer protocol in the middle layer of the stack.  Every other layer has multiple protocols at that layer.
