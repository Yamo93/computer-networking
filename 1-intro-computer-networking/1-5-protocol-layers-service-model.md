# 1.5 Protocol Layers and Their Service Models
## The protocol stack

A-T-N-L-P: "All Traffic Needs Low Ping" // generated by GPT

### Application Layer
Definition: Protocols that are part of a distributed network application.

Packet = message.

### Transport layer
Definition: Transfer of data between one process and another process (typically on different hosts)

Packet = segment.

### Network layer
Definition: Delivery of datagrams from a source host to a destination host (typically).

Packet = datagram.

### Link layer
Definition: Transfer of data between neighboring network devices.

Packet = frame.

### Physical layer
Definition: Transfer of a bit into and out of a transmission media.

Packet = bit.

## Protocol headers
Given a link-layer frame heading from a host to a router with three header fields,
then:
H1 = Link layer
H2 = Network layer
H3 = Transport layer

## Encapsulation
Definition = Taking data from the layer above, adding header fields appropriate for this layer, and then placing the data in the payload field of the “packet” for that layer.
