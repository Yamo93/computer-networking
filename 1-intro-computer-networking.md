| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ethernet                | Wired. Up to 100's Gbps per link.                       |
| 802.11 WiFi             | Wireless. 10's to 100's of Mbps per device.             |
| Cable access network    | Wired. Up to 10's to 100's of Mbps downstream per user. |
| Digital Subscriber Line | Wired. Up to 10's of Mbps downstream per user.          |
| 4G Cellular LTE         | Wireless. Up to 10's of Mbps per device.                |

# 1.3 The Network Core
Forwarding = the local action of moving arriving packets from router's input link to appropriate router output link.
Routing = the global action of determining the source-destination paths taken by packets.

Packet switching:
* Data may be queued before being transmitted due to other users' data that's also queuing for transmission.
* This technique is used in the Internet.
* Congestion loss and variable end-end delays are possible.
* Resources are used on demand, not reserved in advance.

Circuit switching:
* Reserves resources needed for a call from source to destination.
* Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) and Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) are two implementations.
* Was the basis for the telephone call switching from the 20th century and into the beginning of this current century.

### Problem
> Given a circuit-switched network with 4 circuit switches A, B, C and D,
where there are 20 circuits between A and B, 19 circuits between B and C, 15 circuits between C and D, and 16 circuits between D and A, 
then the maximum number of connections that can be ongoing in the network at any one time are: 20 + 19 + 15 + 16 = 70. 

### Definitions of the Internet
* The Internet is made up of access networks at the edge, tier-1 networks at the core, and interconnected regional and content provider networks as well.
* The Internet is made up of a lot of different interconnected networks.

### Packet vs Circuit Switching
Q: 5 users multiplexed over a channel of 10 Mbps. What is better?

Answer:
* Each user generates traffic at an average rate of 2.1 Mbps, generating traffic at a rate of 15 Mbps when transmitting => Neither works well.
* Average rate of 2 Mbps, 2Mbps traffic when transmitting => circuit switching
* Average rate of 0.21 Mbps, 15 Mbps traffic when transmitting => packet switching

# 1.5 Protocol Layers and Their Service Models
## The protocol stack

A-T-N-L-P: "All Traffic Needs Low Ping" // generated by GPT

### Application Layer
Definition: Protocols that are part of a distributed network application.

Packet = message.

### Transport layer
Definition: Transfer of data between one process and another process (typically on different hosts)

Packet = segment.

### Network layer
Definition: Delivery of datagrams from a source host to a destination host (typically).

Packet = datagram.

### Link layer
Definition: Transfer of data between neighboring network devices.

Packet = frame.

### Physical layer
Definition: Transfer of a bit into and out of a transmission media.

Packet = bit.

## Protocol headers
Given a link-layer frame heading from a host to a router with three header fields,
then:
H1 = Link layer
H2 = Network layer
H3 = Transport layer

## Encapsulation
Definition = Taking data from the layer above, adding header fields appropriate for this layer, and then placing the data in the payload field of the “packet” for that layer.

# 1.6 Networks Under Attack
## Security defenses
### Definitions
Authentication = Proving you are who you say you are.

Digital signatures = Used to detect tampering/changing of message contents, and to identify the originator of a message.

Firewall = Specialized “middleboxes” filtering or blocking traffic, inspecting packet contents inspections

Encryption = Provides confidentiality by encoding contents

Access control = Limiting use of resources or capabilities to given users.

# 1.7 History of Computer Networking and the Internet
## Networking history - when did it happen?
Early 1960's = Early studies of packet switching by Baran, Davies, Kleinrock.

Late 1960's = First ARPAnet node operational.

1970's = Internetting: DARPA researchers connect three networks together.

Early 1980's = The Internet Protocol (IP) is standardized in RFC 791.

Late 1980's = Congestion control is added to the TCP protocol.

1990's = The WWW starts up (note: the WWW design started at the end of previous decade).

2000-2010 = Software-defined networking begins.

2010-2020 = The number wireless Internet-connected devices surpasses the number of connected wired devices.

# 1.8 Internet Summary
## "Who Controls The Internet?"
### Internet Institutions
Internet Governance Forum (IGF) = A multistakeholder deliberation body, convened by the United Nations, that does not make decisions but informs and inspires those who do.

Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) = Sets the technical standards for Internet infrastructure -- particularly protocols, device requirements, and data formats -- in more than 9000 Request for Comments (RFCs).

3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) = Sets the technical standards for 3G, 4G, and 5G mobile cellular system.

Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) = Handles (assigns, adjudicates) Internet names, and manages the root level of the DNS.

Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers = Sets the technical standard for Ethernet and WiFi link-layer standards.

### Definition of the "Internet user"
In 2021, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) reported that 61.6% of the worlds’s population are “Internet users”.  What does it mean to be an “Internet user” according to the ITU?

Answer: That someone has used the Internet at least once in the last three months.

### The digital divide
Between 2010 and 2018, which of the following digital divides has changed the least in the US?

Answer: The gap in Internet use between Black and Hispanic populations versus White populations in the US.
